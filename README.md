The project aimed to create dynamic and interactive platform for users to engage in real-time conversations.

Integrated Socket.IO library to enable real-time bidirectional communication, allowing instant message updates and notifications. 

Implemented user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access by incorporating JWT and bcrypt for password hashing. 
There are many functionalities incorporated like - 
1) Search a user by either their name or emailId to initiate the chat.
2) List of chats (either one-to-one or group chat)
3) Profile View
4) Section for message transfer for a selected chat
5) Only admin of the group chat can remove and add the other users.
6) Anyone can update the name of the group chat, and option for leaving the group is also there.
7) Real time messaging and notifications are enabled using Socket.io
8) Typing indicator is also there
